**The Hindu Editorial**

The wedding season has finally wound up. One lasting imprint has been the colossal food wastage. While organising dinners for weddings of close relatives, I always kept a hawkish eye on the “used plates” table. Almost all were piled up with wasted food which could have fed several people. I wondered why even educated people had been so insensitive towards the social obligation of not wasting food. The other day, while travelling by train from New Delhi to Patiala, I chanced upon a B.Tech. student. He spoke of how he had excelled at managing the student mess with software he developed to keep a digital record of wasted food in grams. Every student’s plate gets weighed, and depending on the weight, he has to pay a fine.

It took me back to my UN tenure in Israel. Most restaurants there offered an “all-you-can-eat” package but fined customers if they wasted food. In Japan, it’s considered impolite to waste even a single grain of rice. A few days ago, I saw a video of an Indian wedding. The host had posted two tough waiters at the “used plates” table to ensure that guests left their plates empty. If anyone came with leftovers, they were forced to eat them on the spot, or they were not allowed to keep their plates. What a way to send a great social message across. So think twice before piling food on the plate.
