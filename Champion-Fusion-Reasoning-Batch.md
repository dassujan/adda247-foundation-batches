## 003. Seating Arrangement Lecture – 3  (Circle Based Questions)

I. Based on Bounded Bodies  
(Ex:Circle, Rectangle, Square, Triangle, Pentagon, Hexagon etc)

II. Based on Linear Bodies  
(Ex:Straight line, Parallel line etc.)

Types Of Arrangements
 

1. Direction:  
 I. Clarity of direction is very much important in this topic as the clues used to be dependent on it.  
 II. To fetch the direction as left & right, always assume yourself at that particular point.

Important Points to Remember:

Note: In all the above three situations, we need to assume ourselves at that particular point about which we are required to fetch the direction as left and right.
 

2. Relative Pronoun words:  
Words like who, which, whose, whom etc.

➢ How does the word ‘who’ work?  
 The word, if used in any sentence, works like a relative pronoun. This means it will be related with the 2nd element of the given sentence.  
 Ex:A is 2nd right of B who is 3rd left of C.  
   Here, the word ‘who’ will get related with ‘B’.
 

3. Conjunction words:  
Words like and, but, while, (is), etc.

➢ How does the word ‘and’ work?  
 The word, if used in any sentence, works like a conjunction. This means it will be connected with the 1st element of the given sentence.  
 Ex:A is 2nd right of B and is 3rd left of C.  
   Here, the word ‘and’ will connect with ‘A’.
 

➢ Try to get an overview of the passage given to get an idea about the variety of questions—whether it falls under circular, square, rectangle, straight line, etc.

➢ Try to find the initial clue carefully with which you may start solving the problem.

➢ The initial clue must have a link with another clue.

➢ Check if the direction in which people are facing is inside, outside, mixed, or anything else.

➢ Use projections/possible diagrams if needed.

➢ Don’t be rigid in solving the question with just one diagram.

How to approach Seating Arrangement Questions:


➢ [Use the passage to understand the question’s structure and category.]

➢ [Identify the starting clue and verify its relation to other clues.]

➢ [Determine the arrangement (circular, square, rectangle, straight line, etc.) as per the clues.]
