Resultant Based Series

Directions (151–155): In each of the following questions, two rows of numbers are given. The resultant number in each row is to be worked out separately based on the following rules, and the questions below the rows of numbers are to be answered. The operations of numbers progress from left to right.

**Rules:**

1. If a perfect square number is followed by an even number, then the second number is divided by the square root of the first number and the quotient is taken as resultant.
2. If a composite number is followed by an odd composite number, then both numbers are added.
3. If a multiple of seven is followed by a prime number, then the sum of digits of the first number is subtracted from the second number.
4. If a perfect cube number is followed by an odd number, then the cube root of the first number is multiplied by the second number.
5. If an odd number is followed by a multiple of nine, then the sum of digits of the second number is added to the first number.
6. If a prime number is followed by an even number, then the two numbers are subtracted.

## Alphanumeric Series Lecture – 12 (Step & Multiple Based)

**Step Based Series**

Step 1: Consider the above series. All the letters in the series are changed to the third succeeding letter as per the English alphabetical series.
Step 2: After completing step 1, every fourth letter from the left end is changed to its immediate next letter in the English alphabetical series whereas the letters in the prime-numbered positions from the left end are changed to their immediate previous letter in the English alphabetical series.
Step 3: After completing step 2, the letter which has its corresponding number as the least composite number in the English alphabetical series is added at every fifth position in the series from the left end.
Step 4: After completing step 3, every five letters are arranged in alphabetical order from left to right within themselves to form five-letter words.
Step 4 is the last and final step and the outcome in this step is the final series. As per the steps given above, find out the final alphabet series and answer the following questions given below.

**Important Tips to Solve Substitution Coding**
You will be given sentences and their coded forms. Identify the code for each specific word by finding common words across different sentences.

**Example:**

```
(i)   Champions are winners always        st ex cy fd  
(ii)  Winners work hard daily             cy ez pk yt  
(iii) Hard things are doable              st yt cd mb  
(iv)  But champions always doable         ex fd lz cd  
```

* “are” → st  (common to (i) & (iii))
* “winners” → cy  (common to (i) & (ii))
* “work” → either ez or pk
* “daily” → either ez or pk
* “champions” → either ex or fd
* “always” → either ex or fd



**Concept of “Either/Or”**

* **Case I:** Two words appear exclusively together in one sentence → “either/or” applies.
* **Case II:** Two words appear exclusively across two sentences → “either/or” applies.

## 005. Coding – Decoding Lecture – 5 (Binary & New Pattern Coding)

Binary coding

Direction (56–60): In a system governed by binary logic and transformation rules, the English alphabet is encoded into a unique binary mapping as follows:
A = 00001, B = 00010, C = 00011, …, Z = 11010.

For the given word:

1. Identify each letter’s corresponding binary value according to the above mapping.
2. Apply the following transformations:
   (i) For vowels (A, E, I, O, U), double the numerical value of their binary representation and convert the resulting value back to binary form.
   (ii) For consonants, add 3 to the numerical value of their binary representation and convert the resulting value back to binary form.
3. Reconstruct the sequence using the modified binary representations in the exact order of the letters in the word.

## 007. Lecture – 7 (Machine & Mathematical Based)

Machine coding

**Direction (91–95):**
Numbers in the form of a 4×4 matrix were given:

* First row was represented as **#** having 4 numbers in multiples of 3 starting from 24.
* Second row was represented as **%** having first 4 prime numbers starting from 19.
* Third row was represented as **@** having 4 numbers in multiples of 7 starting from 28.
* Fourth row was represented as **\$** having 4 numbers in multiples of 8 starting from 32.
  The columns were represented as A, B, C and D.

There are four bombs R, S, T and U. Each bomb will burst after receiving a signal of certain frequency based on certain conditions as follows:
I. If there are at least 2 numbers which are multiples of 5, then frequency of the string will be the addition of all the numbers except those multiples of 5.
II. If there are consecutive numbers in the string, then frequency of the string will be the multiplication of the remaining numbers.
III. If there are two numbers multiple of 6, then frequency will be the addition of all the even numbers.
IV. If there are at least two prime numbers in the string, then frequency of the string will be the multiplication of the lowest and the largest number.

**Note:**

1. If none of the given conditions follow, then frequency will be the multiplication of the 3rd lowest and the 3rd largest number.
2. If only string A or B is given then only one string is taken as input.
3. If the final frequency is less than 130 then only **R** will burst, between 130 and 450 then **S**, between 450 and 750 then **T**, and more than 750 then **U**.

*(For example: If K = %B @A #C %A, L = %D @C #A @B)*
%B denotes value in first row and column B, which will be equal to 23. Therefore:

```
K = 23 28 30 19  
This satisfies condition IV.  
Frequency of K = 30 × 19 = 570  

L = 31 42 24 35  
This satisfies condition III.  
Frequency of L = 42 + 24 = 66  

Final frequency = 570 + 66 = 636  
```

Consider the signal K = #B %C #A %D and L = %A #C #D \$B for all the questions.

**Q91.** If only frequency of K is taken as input, then \_\_\_\_ bomb will burst.
A. T B. R C. Can’t be determined D. S E. U

**Q92.** What is the final frequency of both the signals?
A. Between 450 to 750 B. More than 750 C. Between 130 and 450 D. None of these E. Less than 130

**Q93.** If only frequency of L is taken as input, then what value should be added to the frequency of L so that bomb S will burst?
A. 80 B. Can’t be determined C. 400 D. 700 E. 450

**Q94.** If only frequency of K is taken as input, then what value should be subtracted from the frequency of K so that bomb S will burst?
A. 618 B. 305 C. 200 D. 150 E. Can’t be determined

**Q95.** If frequency of L is taken as input, then \_\_\_\_\_ bomb will burst.
A. S B. Can’t be determined C. R D. T E. U

Mathematical coding

**Direction (96–100):**
In a courier delivering unit, items are packed and sent to their respective addresses. Machines check weight, packaging and labeling. If packages meet the criteria they are sent on; others are discarded to repack. Packages move on a conveyor belt to pass through sensors. The signals detected are strings of numbers which map to symbols indicating acceptance or rejection.

**Note:** Signal strings contain either 2 or 3 digits.

**Conditions:**

1. If the value obtained from the sensor is less than 200 then the package is not fit for delivery; symbol = **#**.
2. If the value is ≥ 200 and < 300 then there is a minor packaging issue; symbol = **\$**.
3. If the value is ≥ 300 and < 400 then the package is below standard weight; symbol = **%**.
4. If the value is ≥ 400 and < 500 then the package is perfect; symbol = **\***.
5. If the value is ≥ 500 then the package meets all standards; symbol = **@**.

**Example—Package A:** 16 20 127 211

* 16 (even) → 20 ⇒ 20 – 16 = 4
* 4 → 127 ⇒ 4 + 127 = 131
* 131 → 211 ⇒ 131 + 211 = 342 ⇒ **%**

**Example—Package B:** 9 15 216 14

* 9 (odd) → 15 ⇒ 9 × 15 = 135
* 135 → 216 ⇒ 216 – 135 = 81
* 81 → 14 ⇒ 81 – 14 = 67

**Further Rules:**
a. Even → even: write their difference.
b. Even → odd: write their sum.
c. Odd → prime: write their sum.
d. Prime → prime: write their sum.
e. Odd → composite: write their product.
f. Odd → even: write their difference.

**Q96.** If string of package C = 9 21 42 28 then what symbol will be displayed?
A. \* B. % C. # D. @ E. None of these

**Q97.** If string of package X = 16 18 216 279 then what symbol will be displayed?
A. % B. # C. @ D. \* E. None of these

**Q98.** If string of package L = 11 19 35 46 and P = 10 49 73 124 then what symbol will be displayed if both values are added?
A. \* B. % C. @ D. # E. None of these

**Q99.** If string of package X = 34 15 118 156 then how much least value would be needed to display ‘\$’?
A. 164 B. 173 C. 113 D. 166 E. None of these

**Q100.** If string of package X = 12 16 200 27 then how much least value would be subtracted to display ‘#’?
A. 64 B. 13 C. 24 D. 16 E. None of these
